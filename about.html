      Hi, I’m <strong>Vikash</strong> 👋
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently upskilling myself day by day by learning programming,
      solving problems, and trying to think more clearly with every step.
      This site is my way of slowing down and putting those thoughts into words.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t write because I know everything — I write because it helps me
      understand things better. If something clicks for me, I share it here
      so it might help someone else who’s also eager to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re learning, struggling, revising basics, or just curious about
      how others approach problem-solving, you’re in the right place.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 32px;">
      Thanks for stopping by 🙂
