    <p>
      I started writing because I’m genuinely eager to learn and improve myself
      in this fast-moving tech world. Writing helps me slow down, reflect on what
      I’m learning, and understand things more clearly.
    </p>

    <p>
      This blog is not about showing expertise or pretending to know everything.
      It’s about sharing what I learn along the way — the mistakes, the confusion,
      and the small moments where things finally start to make sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m starting this journey by focusing on <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</strong>.
      I’ve recently begun learning DSA seriously, and my goal is simple:
      to become <strong>1% better every day</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I practice, I’ll solve problems and share:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>How I approach a problem</li>
      <li>Different ways to think about the solution</li>
      <li>The code that finally worked</li>
      <li>What confused me and how I fixed it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I believe problem-solving becomes much easier when ideas are explained
      clearly and step by step. If my way of thinking helps even one person
      understand something better, then this blog is doing its job.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you’re learning DSA, revising fundamentals, or just trying to improve
      your problem-solving skills, I hope you’ll find something useful here.
    </p>

      This is just the beginning.
